# E-Commerce Platform Dockerization

This project aims to containerize an e-commerce platform using Docker, allowing for easy deployment and scalability.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- Node.js and npm
- MongoDB (start the MongoDB service with `sudo service mongod start`)

## Setting Up the Client (Frontend)

Navigate to the client folder:

```bash
cd client
```

**Install dependencies:**

```bash
npm install
```

## Setting Up the Backend

Open a new terminal window or tab.

Navigate to the backend folder:

```bash
cd path/to/backend
```

**Install dependencies:**

```bash
npm install
```

## Dockerizing MongoDB

To Dockerize MongoDB, you can use the official MongoDB Docker image. Here's how you can do it:

1. **Create a docker-compose.yml file in the root directory with the provided content, including the MongoDB service:**

```yaml
version: '3.7'

services:
  mongodb:
    image: mongo
    container_name: mongodb
    ports:
      - "27017:27017"
    volumes:
      - ./data:/data/db
```

2. **Build and run the MongoDB container using Docker Compose:**

```bash
docker-compose up --build mongodb
```

## Dockerizing the Client (Frontend)

1. **Create a Dockerfile in the client directory with the provided content.**

2. **Create a docker-compose.yml file in the root directory with the provided content, including the client service.**

3. **Build the client image using Docker Compose:**

```bash
docker-compose up --build client
```

## Dockerizing the Backend

1. **Create a Dockerfile in the backend directory with the provided content.**

2. **Modify the docker-compose.yml file to include the backend service.**

3. **Build the backend image using Docker Compose:**

```bash
docker-compose up --build backend
```

## Testing the Application

Once all containers are up and running, open a web browser and navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to access the client (frontend) application.

Test the functionality of the application, including adding a product if necessary.
